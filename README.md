# Cancer-Detection-Model-Research-QBIO-401-

This repository contains an academic project focused on implementing and testing machine learning models to detect gastric cancer using 10 key metabolites. The project is based on a research paper, but the TensorFlow models I developed demonstrated superior performance compared to the original research-grade models.

## Project Features:
- **Models:** Files containing the TensorFlow models that achieved the best performance.
- **Data:** All the datasets used for the project.
- **Notebooks:** The notebooks that were used for the machine learning implementation.

You can find the research paper that served as the basis for this project [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-46043-y).
